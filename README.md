# Travel-agency-app
This app is an Invoicing platform for a Travel Agency. The app intends to store Customer data, generate Bills and reports. 
Travel agencies will have a contract with many companies for providing cab facilities for their employees. 
Once the ride is complete, the driver would come back to the agency with ride data along with the employee information. The respective company will be billed 
once in a fortnight or a month for all the rides of their employees. This consolidated billing and individual billing is achieved in the 
application. The app will provide report between any dates with the bills and the revenue details as well which would be helpful in internal 
or external auditing.
